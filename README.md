# Project 1 - *Tipster*

**Tipster** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Ava Crnkovic-Rubsamen**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Dark/light mode available on the settings page.
- [X] Improvement/personalization of the UI.

## Notes

I encountered challenges with saving user data on my settings page and having it appear when I returned from editing settings. I also encountered challenges with constraints which I incorporated into my settings page and with changing the color of the placeholder text in dark mode. I worked through these challenges by using the Apple Developer Docs, Stack Overflow, and asking a TA to clarify constraints for me.
